Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership rental and return back has become automatic.
Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently,
there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles.
Bike-sharing programs are becoming more and more popular in recent Today,.

✔️ Insights:
✔️ Overall: Casual is less than registered in the two years.
  That can help us in (Operations Capacity, Cost, Budgeting, etc.) Planning to Considerate to increase about 40% to 60% as Casual rate from Register Daily/Monthly/Yearly Rate.
✔️ Seasons: Fall reach 31% of Avg Total Rents, then summer 27%, Then Winter 26%.
  Than can help us during distribute the Manpower, Costs, and Purchasing Maintenance/Renewals OPS to be in the right time to avoid any disagreement with Customers requirements.
✔️ Months: Usually Dec & Jan are the low rents, and from May to Oct are the High rents, but from Feb to Apr + Nov are mean.
  During the High rents Months: Our resources need to be ready to help customers during the season.
  During the low rents Months: We can use these months to make the necessary maintenance and renovation of assets.
✔️ Time Period:
  High Period : Afternoon for Casual & Evening for Registered.
  Low Period : Early Morning & Night for Both.
  That will help us to Distribute our resources & Assets & Products to help customers as per Rents count of High/Low periods.
✔️ Weather sit:
  Customers usually rents during Clear/Mist Weather sit.
  That will let us should follow the weather update.
✔️ Week Day & Hourly EDA:
  Registered has High Rents during Weekends (Usually be increasing from 7 AM till 10 AM & From 16 PM till 19 PM).
  Casual has High Rents during Working Days (Usually be increasing from 10 AM till 20 PM).
  That’s mean: registered Customers may use the bikes during going to Work/School, and Casual may use the bikes for fun/sports.
  Also this will help us for the distribution type of bikes to help customers and keep satisfaction.
